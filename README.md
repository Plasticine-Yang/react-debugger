# React Debugger

A convenient react debugger.

## Usage

For example, let's take debugging React version 18.2.0.

```shell
yarn
yarn install:18-2-0
yarn build:18-2-0
yarn debug:18-2-0
```

Open VSCode, select the desired configuration for the React version you want to debug, and run it. Isn't it simple!
